The project idea was taken from the FrontEndMentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3) website. In this project, I practiced my skills in responsiveness, ReactRouterDom,
styled-components, and React.

To start this app, you need to open the integrated terminal in the backend folder and type "npm run server" or "yarn server."
Once this is done, also open the integrated terminal in the frontend folder and type "npm run dev" or "yarn dev."
